# Numerical Methods Implementation in Python, C++, Fortran, and MATLAB  
*A comprehensive collection of numerical methods implementations for engineering applications*  

---

### **Introduction**  
This repository contains implementations of numerical methods covered in the *ME381: Numerical Methods in Engineering* syllabus, translated into **Python**, **C++**, **Fortran**, and **MATLAB**. These scripts are designed to solve engineering problems such as linear equations, interpolation, differential equations, and finite element analysis, following best practices for clarity and reproducibility .  

---

### **Purpose**  
- To provide a **multi-language reference** for numerical methods.  
- To align with the ME381 syllabus for academic and practical learning.  
- To demonstrate **cross-language consistency** in solving engineering problems .  

---

### **Features**  
1. **Linear Equation Solvers**:  
   - Gaussian Elimination, Newton-Raphson, Jacobi/Seidel Iteration (Python/C++/Fortran/MATLAB).  
2. **Interpolation**:  
   - Newton’s Forward/Backward, Lagrange’s, Stirling’s, and Bessel’s methods.  
3. **Numerical Integration**:  
   - Trapezoidal Rule, Simpson’s Rule, Gaussian Quadrature.  
4. **ODE Solvers**:  
   - Euler’s Method, Runge-Kutta (4th Order), Picard’s Iteration.  
5. **Finite Element Method (FEM)**:  
   - 1D structural analysis and mesh generation tools.  
6. **Variational Methods**:  
   - Rayleigh-Ritz, Galerkin’s, Least-Squares Residual.  

---

### **Installation**  
1. **Python**:  
   ```bash  
   pip install numpy scipy matplotlib  
   ```  
2. **C++/Fortran**:  
   - Use compilers like `g++` (C++) or `gfortran` (Fortran).  
3. **MATLAB**:  
   - Ensure MATLAB R2020a+ is installed.
